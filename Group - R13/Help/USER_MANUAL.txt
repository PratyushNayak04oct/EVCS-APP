# User Manual - EVCS(Enhanced Visual Cryptography Scheme)

## 1. Overview
This web application allows users to interact via a frontend built in React. The backend is powered by Express.js, which communicates with Java code to perform core operations like processing, computation, or data handling.

## 2. How to Run the Project

### Step 1: Requirements
- Node.js (v18 or later)
- Java JDK (v17 or the version used)

1. Navigate to the backend folder:
2. npm install
3. npm start

---

### Step 3: Running the Frontend (React)
1. Navigate to the frontend folder:
2. npm install
3. npm run dev


2. Access the app at `http://localhost:5173` or the port shown in terminal.

## 3. Using the Application
- Navigate through the interface using the navbar.
- Submit forms or inputs that trigger Java-based processing via backend.
- Responses will be shown on the screen after Express receives output from Java.

## 4. Troubleshooting
- Make sure Java is added to PATH and runs from terminal.
- Ensure both frontend and backend are running simultaneously.
- Check terminal for any errors from Express or Java.
